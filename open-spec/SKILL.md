name: open-spec
description: Open a spec-authoring session over the project/ workspace. Use when the user says open-spec, $open-spec, or "open the spec" — it scopes the session to project/*, loads the spec contracts, and shifts into discussing desired outcomes before any spec is written.
---
First use the project-local `$ikispec` skill if it is not already in
context. It is the single source of truth for the `project/` shapes and hard
invariants this session operates under.

# Open Spec

**Opening the spec starts a spec-authoring session.** From this point until the
session is sealed, the work is *talking about* what the project should become —
not building it, and not yet writing it down.

An open session means:

- **Scope is `project/*`.** The session governs the codebase this `project/`
  sits at the root of, and any writes it eventually produces land only under
  `project/` — per `ikispec`'s scope and authoring-write boundaries. No
  implementation, build, or test files are created, edited, scaffolded, or
  committed while the session is open, and direct implementation is not
  offered as a next step.
- **The operator describes desired outcomes.** Listen, ask what's needed to
  follow, and hold the goal at outcome altitude. Failure is part of the
  outcome: what the operator wants to happen when things go wrong belongs in
  the discussion at the same altitude as success. Track what's settled and
  what's still open, but do not start writing spec documents — discussion is
  not authoring.
- **Every existing Decision is open.** An extension session inherits a
  `project/` full of prior choices; none of them are settled while authoring.
  Read them as input: what was chosen, and the reasoning that produced it.
  Never treat one as a closed door, and never answer the operator by saying a
  path is unavailable because the spec already decided otherwise. If a prior
  Decision or Rejected entry still holds, re-argue it on its merits here and
  say so; if the goal on the table breaks it, that is a Decision to rewrite,
  not an objection to raise. The gate is on writing `project/`, not on
  reconsidering it (see `ikispec`, *Sealed governs writes, not questions*).
- **The session has two named exits.** `$grill-me` interrogates the goal one
  question at a time until every unknown is resolved; `$seal-spec` writes the
  settled goal into `project/` (product, research, design, plan) in one
  automated pass and leaves the workspace ready for the next `ralph` run. The
  usual arc is **open-spec → grill-me → seal-spec**, but the operator drives:
  wait to be told which move comes next.

When the session opens, confirm briefly that the spec is open and scoped to
`project/*`, note whether `project/` already exists (greenfield or extension),
and **check the findings tray**: list `project/issues/` in this tree (and the
root umbrella's, when opening a subproject) and surface any unresolved issues
before the discussion starts, asking whether any belong in this session's
scope. An issue the session absorbs is deleted by the move that specs its fix
(`ikispec`: resolution is deletion); one it does not touch stays filed. Then
let the operator talk.
